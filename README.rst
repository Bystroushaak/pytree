### Note: we are actively looking for a person/group to build a better Python Tree Notation implementation. https://github.com/treenotation/jtree/issues/19 You can fork this one or start one fresh, and hopefully we can link to yours instead of ours. If you do make one, let us know how we can help. Also, if you were to keep a journal about your experience so we all can learn how to make the process of creating a new Tree Notation implementation in Language N/N+1 easier, that would be great!
